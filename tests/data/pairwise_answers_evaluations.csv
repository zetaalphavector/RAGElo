0,agent1,agent2,"Assistant A correctly answers the user's question by stating that Bras√≠lia is the capital of Brazil, citing a relevant document [0] that directly answers the question. 

Assistant B, on the other hand, provides historical information about the capital of Brazil, stating that Rio de Janeiro used to be the capital until the 60s, citing document [1]. While this information is accurate, it does not directly answer the user's question about the current capital of Brazil.

Comparing the two responses, Assistant A provides a direct and correct answer to the user's question, while Assistant B provides historical context but does not answer the user's question about the current capital. Therefore, Assistant A's response is more helpful and accurate in this context.

Based on the correctness, helpfulness, and accuracy of the responses, my final verdict is: [[A]]",A
1,agent1,agent2,"Both assistants correctly answer the user's question, stating that Paris is the capital of France. Assistant A provides a straightforward answer, directly citing the relevant document [2]. Assistant B, on the other hand, provides additional information about Lyon being the second largest city in France, citing the irrelevant document [3], before stating that Paris is the capital of France, citing the relevant document [2].

The main difference between the two responses is that Assistant B provides additional information about Lyon, which is not relevant to the user's question. While this information is not incorrect, it does not contribute to answering the user's question about the capital of France.

Therefore, based on the correctness, relevance, and conciseness of the responses, Assistant A provides a better answer to the user's question.
