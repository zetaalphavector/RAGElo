0,agent2,agent1,"Both Assistant A and Assistant B are tasked with answering the user question about the capital of Brazil. 

Assistant A references document [1], which discusses Rio de Janeiro as a former capital but fails to provide the current capital, Brasília. Therefore, while Assistant A acknowledges a historical fact, it does not directly answer the user's question about the current capital.

Assistant B, on the other hand, directly cites document [0], which explicitly states that Brasília is the capital of Brazil. This response is clear, accurate, and directly addresses the user's question.

In comparing the two responses, Assistant B provides a complete and correct answer, while Assistant A does not answer the question at all. Assistant A's response is less helpful and lacks the necessary information to satisfy the user's inquiry.

Given this evaluation, the final verdict is: [[B]]",B
1,agent2,agent1,"Both Assistant A and Assistant B correctly answer the user question by stating that Paris is the capital of France. However, their approaches differ in terms of relevance and clarity.

Assistant A begins by referencing a document that is not relevant to the question ([3]), which discusses Lyon but does not pertain to the capital of France. This inclusion of irrelevant information detracts from the overall quality of the response. However, it does correctly cite the relevant document ([2]) that states Paris is the capital.

Assistant B, on the other hand, directly and succinctly answers the question by stating that Paris is the capital of France and cites the relevant document ([2]) without introducing any irrelevant information. This makes Assistant B's response clearer and more focused.

In comparing the two responses, Assistant B provides a more straightforward and relevant answer, while Assistant A's inclusion of irrelevant information weakens its overall effectiveness. 

Therefore, the final verdict is: [[B]]",B
