0,agent1,agent2,"Assistant A correctly answers the user's question by stating that Brasília is the capital of Brazil, citing a relevant document [0] that directly answers the question. 

Assistant B, on the other hand, provides historical information about the capital of Brazil, stating that Rio de Janeiro used to be the capital until the 60s. While this information is accurate and comes from a somewhat relevant document [1], it does not answer the user's question about the current capital of Brazil.

The main difference between the two responses is that Assistant A provides the current capital of Brazil, directly answering the user's question, while Assistant B provides historical information that does not directly answer the user's question.

Therefore, based on the correctness, helpfulness, and relevance to the user's question, Assistant A provides a better answer.

1,agent1,agent2,"Both Assistant A and Assistant B correctly answer the user's question, stating that Paris is the capital of France. They both cite document [2] as the source of their information, which is relevant to the user's question.

The difference between the two responses lies in the additional information provided by Assistant B. Assistant B mentions that Lyon is the second largest city in France, citing document [3]. However, this information is not relevant to the user's question about the capital of France. 

While Assistant B's response is more detailed, the additional detail does not contribute to answering the user's question. Therefore, the length and additional detail of Assistant B's response should not be considered as a factor in favor of Assistant B.

Based on the above analysis, Assistant A's response is more focused and directly answers the user's question without any unnecessary information.
