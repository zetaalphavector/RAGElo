    "# **Evaluating multiple RAG pipelines with RAGElo**\n",
    "Unlike other LLM and RAG evaluation frameworks that try to evaluate every individual LLM answer individually, RAGElo focuses on comparing **pairs** of answers in an Elo-style tournament.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that, without a golden answer, LLMs can't really judge any individual answer in isolation. Rather, analyzing if answer A is better than answer B is a more reliable metric of quality, and makes it easier to decide if a new RAG pipeline is better than another.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAGElo works in three steps when evaluating a RAG pipeline\n",
    "1. Gather all documents retrieved by all agents and annotate their relevance to the user's query.\n",
    "2. For each question, generate \"_games_\" between agents, asking the judging LLM to analyze if one agent is better than another, rather than assigning individual scores to each answer.\n",
    "3. With these games, compute the Elo score for each agent, creating a final ranking of agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, RAGElo is **agnostic** to your pipeline. Meaning, it will not directly call your RAG system, and can work with any framework or pipeline you use. When used as a library, as we do here, we should create the `Query` objects with your agent's answers, as we show below."
