    "# **Evaluating multiple RAG pipelines with RAGElo**\n",
    "Unlike other LLM and RAG evaluation frameworks that try to evaluate every individual LLM answer individually, RAGElo focuses on comparing **pairs** of answers in an Elo-style tournament.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that, without a golden answer, LLMs can't really judge any individual answer in isolation. Rather, analyzing if answer A is better than answer B is a more reliable metric of quality, and makes it easier to decide if a new RAG pipeline is better than another.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAGElo works in three steps when evaluating a RAG pipeline\n",
    "1. Gather all documents retrieved by all agents and annotate their relevance to the user's query.\n",
    "2. For each question, generate \"_games_\" between agents, asking the judging LLM to analyze if one agent is better than another, rather than assigning individual scores to each answer.\n",
    "3. With these games, compute the Elo score for each agent, creating a final ranking of agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, RAGElo is **agnostic** to your pipeline. Meaning, it will not directly call your RAG system, and can work with any framework or pipeline you use. When used as a library, as we do here, we should create the `Query` objects with your agent's answers, as we show below."

       " PairwiseGame(evaluation=AnswerEvaluatorResult(qid='What is vaccum optimizer ?', raw_answer=\"Both Assistant A and Assistant B provide a correct and comprehensive explanation of the Vacuum Optimizer in Qdrant. They explain its function in managing the accumulation of deleted records within a segment repository, how it marks records as deleted instead of deleting them immediately, and the conditions under which the optimizer is triggered. Both responses also mention the ability to configure parameters such as the minimal fraction of deleted vectors and the minimal number of vectors in a segment required for optimization.\\n\\nThe key differences between the two responses are:\\n1. **Citation Style**: Assistant A suggests referring to the documentation for more details but does not provide a direct link or specific location, whereas Assistant B provides a clickable link (although it's formatted as a placeholder and not an actual URL).\\n2. **Detail on Configuration**: Both assistants mention the configuration options available for the Vacuum Optimizer, but neither goes into detail about how to access or modify these configurations beyond a general statement.\\n\\nGiven that both responses are nearly identical in content and accuracy, and both suggest referring to the documentation for more details without providing specific guidance on where to find this information in the documentation, the decision comes down to the usefulness and accessibility of the additional information provided. Assistant B attempts to provide a direct link to the documentation, which could be more helpful if it were a functioning URL. However, since it's presented as a placeholder, it does not add actual value over Assistant A's response.\\n\\nIn conclusion, both responses are equally effective in explaining the concept of the Vacuum Optimizer in Qdrant, and neither provides a significant advantage over the other in terms of detail or helpfulness. Therefore, the verdict is: [[C]] for a tie.\", answer='C', exception=None, agent=None, agent_a='rag_response_512_4_reranked', agent_b='rag_response_512_5', pairwise=True), metadata=None, agent_a_answer=AgentAnswer(evaluation=None, metadata=None, agent='rag_response_512_4_reranked', text='The Vacuum Optimizer in Qdrant is used to address the accumulation of deleted records within a segment repository.
